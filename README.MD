# Gumloop Unified Model Context Protocol (guMCP)

guMCP is an open-source collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that can be run both remotely and locally. The project aims to create the largest collection of MCP servers with a unified backend, fostering a community around AI integrations and the future of AGI.

## Overview

While many MCP server providers are closed source, and open-source alternatives typically only support local hosting through stdio, guMCP provides:

- A comprehensive collection of MCP servers that work both locally and remotely
- Support for both stdio and SSE (Server-Sent Events) transports
- A unified backend architecture for consistent implementation
- Full open-source access to encourage community contributions

## Features

- **Dual Transport Support**: All servers support both:

  - Local hosting through stdio
  - Remote hosting through SSE

- **Unified Backend**: Consistent implementation patterns across all servers

- **Extensive Server Collection**: Including servers for:
  - File systems and databases
  - Development tools
  - Web and browser automation
  - Productivity and communication
  - AI and specialized tools

## Getting Started

[![Watch the video](https://www.gumloop.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fmcp%2FGuideVideo.png&w=1920&q=75)](https://vimeo.com/1070438737/8dea56e6a1)

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gumloop/guMCP.git
cd guMCP
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env  # Then edit with your configuration
```

## Usage

### Running Servers Locally (stdio)

```bash
python src/servers/local.py --server=simple-tools-server
```

For convenience, we also provide a lightweight MCP Client to start and connect to stdio servers. Usage:

```bash
 python tests/clients/LocalMCPTestClient.py --server=simple-tools-server
```

### Running Servers Remotely (SSE)

An SSE server can be run locally. This will provide a single URL and host every server available.

To start the SSE development server, run:

```bash
./start_remote_dev_server.sh
```

For convenience, we also prove a lightweight MCP Client to connect to SSE servers. Usage:

```bash
python tests/clients/RemoteMCPTestClient.py --endpoint=http://localhost:8000/simple-tools-server/local
```
